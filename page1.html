    Nothing about depression is easy. But the way it affects a person’s daily life is arguably the most difficult part of the disorder. The reality is that these symptoms all have a significant effect on routines, from running errands to social situations to even just going to sleep. As with any medical issue, the more knowledge you’re armed with, the better. That’s why we rounded up just some of the ways depression influences a person’s day-to-day life.
    There are multiple barriers to getting proper help, from the high price tag of professional support to issues with access to care. Another big reason there’s a treatment gap? The negative stereotype that having a mental health issue makes a person weak, according to Ken Duckworth, the medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. We asked our social media community to share how treatment has helped them with the disorder. Of course, what works for one person may not work for another. It’s important to check with a doctor on the best method for you. There should be no stigma when it comes to getting healthy.
