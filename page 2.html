    She wasn’t here with him, at the dorms. Her shadow followed however. Kirishima hugged his arms over his chest at a feeble attempt to hide away from his mother’s shackles. Her vain attempts to scrub scars off his skin, leaving him bright red and blotchy. Sometimes bleeding. She wanted a perfect child. With a perfect face, an equally perfect body and a flashy quirk. He wasn’t though. He was plain and dull and dreary. Bestowed with a boring quirk.
    Was any of it his fault?
     Swirling from the blackest corners of his room, his mother’s shadowy hands slithered across, snake like and crept up his body, winding like vines, touching his scars. Prodding at the new ones, ghosting the old. Kirishima undid the knot on his gym trousers, letting them pool at his feet, only in his boxers now. The vines travelled south. Wrapping themselves around his thighs, his calf and finally his feet. There was a huge laceration on his leg. From his upper thigh to his knee, stitched and healed by recovery girl. The scar would remain.
